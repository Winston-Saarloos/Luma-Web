# Component Export/Import Rules

## Component Structure
- When creating new components, export them directly from their component file
- Avoid creating unnecessary index.ts files for simple component exports
- Use descriptive component names that match the file name
- Place components in appropriate folders based on their purpose

## Import/Export Patterns
- Import components directly from their source files: `import { ComponentName } from "@/components/path/to/component-file"`
- Only create index.ts files when you need to re-export multiple components or provide a public API
- Use named exports for components: `export function ComponentName()`
- Avoid default exports for React components unless there's a specific reason

## File Organization
- Group related components in folders with descriptive names
- Use kebab-case for folder and file names
- Keep component files focused on a single responsibility
- Place shared utilities in a separate utils folder

## Code Quality
- Always use TypeScript for React components
- Include proper type definitions for props
- Use consistent naming conventions across the project
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
